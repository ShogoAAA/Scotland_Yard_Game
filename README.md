# Scotland_Yard_Game

How to play
 - run the Main.java (src/main/Main.java)

Two versions of MrX
 - as default, MrX is CleverMrX who is trying to avoid the place where the detective can go in the next step
 - if you want to play easier mode, you need to change MrX instance in GameMaster class
 - change MrX class instance "mrx" from from CleverMrX to RandomMrX in the constructor of the class
 
if you win, the pop up will tell you that you win.
if you lose, the pop up will tell you that you lose

Test play
 - as default, it shows where MrX is so that you can know the game works well
 - if you want to play the real game, you need to change the boolean value in ScotlandYardFrame.java
 - if you change "showAlways" boolean from true to false in the constructor of the class, you can actually play the game
